    <h1>Welcome to <em>The Recollector</em></h1>
    <p class="tagline">An AI-Powered Memory Companion</p>

    <p><strong>Our mission:</strong>  
    We’re a team of engineers building technology that helps people stay connected to what matters most — their memories. For individuals living with Alzheimer’s and other cognitive challenges, remembering a password can be stressful. So we asked: what if your memories could be the key?</p>

    <p><strong>The Recollector</strong> transforms authentication into a gentle, memory-reinforcing experience. Instead of typing a password, users simply recognize familiar photos — moments, faces, places — to securely log in.</p>

    <p>Just upload 5 meaningful images. These become your personal “memory key.” When you log in, you'll complete a series of short visual challenges to identify them among lookalikes. Each round is a moment of reconnection — not just security.</p>

    <p>It’s not just for security. It’s for preserving the past, supporting the present, and strengthening memory through familiarity and repetition — with the help of AI.</p>
